# The current combination of dependencies for SLCT and Luigi is not compatible with projects that run on Python 3.8.
# The latest version of docutils, version 0.21.1, is required to run on Python 3.9 or higher.
# As a temporary fix, until support for Python 3.8 is dropped (which is estimated to be around 6 months),
# we are explicitly requiring a version of docutils that is less than or equal to 0.20.1 in SLCT.
# Once support for Python 3.8 is dropped, this dependency can be removed as it is only needed as a transitive dependency.
